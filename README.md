# Eatlab-Manifold
These are the Jupyter Notebook files I have used during my internship at EATLAB,  where I devised machine learning algorithms to 
describe and distinguish manifolds in consumer behavioral datasets.

Unfortunately, the raw data I worked with throughout the internship is the property of EATLAB; I therefore have no 
right to share it in this repository. The files have been removed, which will result in the notebooks raising errors. However,
the code I have written can still be seen to obtain an idea of algorithms I have devised and the statistical procedures I have 
conducted on the data.
